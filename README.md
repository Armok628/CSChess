# AWTChess

This is a Java applet written with AWT by me in my junior year of high school for AP Computer Science 1.

Someday I'd like to update this and switch to JFrame, but realistically, I'm probably just going to leave it alone.

This applet allows for a full game of chess with correctly enforced rules, except for obscure stalemate rules (such as a stalemate being caused by the board being in the same position X times in a row).
This includes castling, en-passant, pawn promotion, and checkmate and stalemate detection.
