# MJChess

This is a Java applet written with AWT by me, Mark Johnson, in my junior year of high school for AP Computer Science 1.

Someday I'd like to update this and switch to JFrame, but I'm going to leave it as is until further notice.

This applet allows for a full game of chess with correctly enforced rules, except for obscure stalemate rules.
Yes, this includes castling, en-passant, pawn promotion, and checkmate and stalemate detection.
